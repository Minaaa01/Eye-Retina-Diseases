            Retina, layer of nervous tissue that covers the inside of the back two-thirds of the eyeball, in which stimulation by light occurs,
             initiating the sensation of vision. The retina is actually an extension of the brain, formed
            embryonically from neural tissue and connected to the brain proper by the optic nerve Retinal diseases cause damage to any part of the retina. Untreated
            retinal diseases can lead to severe vision loss and even blindness. With early detection, some retinal diseases can be treated,
             while others can be controlled or slowed down to preserve, or even restore vision Retinal diseases vary widely,
              but most of them cause visual symptoms. Retinal diseases can affect any part of your retina, a thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of your eye.
              The retina contains millions of light-sensitive cells (rods and cones)and other nerve cells that receive and organize visual information. Your retina sends
              this information to your brain through your optic nerve, enabling you to see.
             Treatment is available for some retinal diseases. Depending on your condition,
             treatment goals may be to stop or slow the disease and preserve, improve or restore your vision. Untreated,
              some retinal diseases can cause severe vision loss or blindness.Common retinal diseases and conditions include:Diabetic retinopathy.Age related macular degeneration(AMD)

          <P> In a healthy eye, the lens is clear and allows light to pass through.
              Light is focused by the cornea and lens onto a thin layer of tissue called the retina
              The retina works like the film in a camera.When light hits the retina, tiny cells collect the light signals and convert them into electrical
              signals, which are then sent through the optic nerve and to the brain, where they are processed into the images we see.

           <h5>cataract image</h5>
                <P> Cataracts are an eye condition caused when the lens of the eye develops cloudy patches. Over time these patches usually grow bigger,
                   causing blurry, misty vision.There are different types of cataracts, depending on which part of the eye’s lens is affected: 
                   they can affect the centre, the sides, or the back of the lens. They can appear in just one 
                   eye or in both eyes, although they may not develop at the same time. Eventually, if they’re not treated, cataracts can lead to blindness.

                  <P> 
                    Glaucoma is not just one eye disease, but a group of eye conditions resulting in optic nerve damage, which may cause loss of vision. 
                    Glaucoma occurs when the internalpressure of the eyes increases enough to damage the nerve fibers in the optic nerve and cause vision loss. 
                    The optic nerve is the key to our sight. It is composed of around one million individual nerve fibers and transmits visual signals from the eye to the brain. 
                    Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. 
                    Glaucoma can damage your vision so gradually that you may not notice any loss of vision until the disease is at an advanced stage.
