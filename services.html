             Retina, layer of nervous tissue that covers the inside of the back two-thirds of the eyeball, in which stimulation by light occurs,
             initiating the sensation of vision. The retina is actually an extension of the brain, formed
            embryonically from neural tissue and connected to the brain proper by the optic nerve Retinal diseases cause damage to any part of the retina. Untreated
            retinal diseases can lead to severe vision loss and even blindness. With early detection, some retinal diseases can be treated,
             while others can be controlled or slowed down to preserve, or even restore vision Retinal diseases vary widely,
              but most of them cause visual symptoms. Retinal diseases can affect any part of your retina, a thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of your eye.
              The retina contains millions of light-sensitive cells (rods and cones)and other nerve cells that receive and organize visual information. Your retina sends
              this information to your brain through your optic nerve, enabling you to see.
             Treatment is available for some retinal diseases. Depending on your condition,
             treatment goals may be to stop or slow the disease and preserve, improve or restore your vision. Untreated,
              some retinal diseases can cause severe vision loss or blindness.Common retinal diseases and conditions include:Diabetic retinopathy.Age related macular degeneration(AMD)
              glaucoma,cataract
